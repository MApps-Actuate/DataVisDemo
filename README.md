The Data Vis demo highlights the characteristics of good visualizations. It is intended for anyone who interested in learning how to create meaningful visualizations. This demo differs from others by being very instructional, instead of telling a story or presenting a scenario. It benefits the audience to learn characteristics of good visualizations so they can apply the same principles in their designs. It also helps them see what can be done using BIRT and/or BIRT Dashboards.
